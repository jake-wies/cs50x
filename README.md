# cs50x
A repo of my solutions to the psets in Harvard's online CS50 course through edX

The course is mainly taught in C, therefore my intial commits for early psets will be written in C, unless stated otherwise.

The code may contain frequent comments. These are purely for educational purposes and will hopefully help others understand how to tackle the spec
