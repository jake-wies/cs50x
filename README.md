# cs50x
A repo of my solutions to the psets in Harvard's online CS50 course through edX.

The course is mainly taught in C, therefore my intial commits for early psets will be written in C, unless stated otherwise.

The code may contain frequent comments. These are purely for educational purposes and will hopefully help others understand how to tackle the spec.

Certain conventions are used at the beginning of this course. One such convention that I will point out is the use of the 'string' data type

being used instead of the 'char*' data type. You will only see 'string' being used in psets 1-3. The class is then directed to use 'char*'.
