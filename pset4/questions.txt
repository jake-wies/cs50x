0. How many different colors does each format support?

    -BMP supports 32-bit color, close to 4 million colors.
    -GIF supports 8-bit color, up to 256 different colors.
    -JPEG supports 24-bits of color depth or 16.7 million colors.
    -PNG supports 8-bit color up 24-bit color giving close to 16 million
    -different colors.

1. Which format supports animation?

    -GIF

2. What's the difference betwee lossy and lossless compression?

    -Lossy compression eliminates unnecessary information to make the
    file smaller.

    -Lossless compression is a process that will allow you to recreate the original
    file as it was exactly. All of the file's data is broken up into small chunks
    that can be put back together again.

3.  Which of these formats is lossly compressed?

    -JPEG

4.  What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file system?

    -Two things happen when a file is deleted on a FAT file system. The first character in the file's directory
    is modified by the system. This signals that the file has been deleted. Second, the FAT clusters of the file are
    moved to the hard drive's free cluster list. The actual file is left alone, and thus, doesn't actually delete
    the file.

5.  What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered?

    -Educate myself on the proper techniques to sanitize disk drives, and use a technique such as overwriting data with a
    few passes of random data will usually make those deleted files irrecoverable.

6.  What’s <stdint.h>?

    -The header stdint.h declares sets of integer types having specified widths.

7.  What’s the point of using <uint8_t>, <uint32_t>, <int32_t>, and <uint16_t> in a program?

    - These are exact-width integer types that designate either a signed or unsigned (notice the u) integer type
    with a width designated by size N bits.

    example: uintN_t -> an unsigned integer type with width size N bits.
             intN_t -> a signed integer type with width size N bits.

8.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively? (Assume a 32-bit architecture like the CS50 Appliance.).

    - BYTE: 1 byte
    - DWORD: 4 bytes
    - LONG: 4 bytes
    - WORD: 2 bytes

9.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? (Leading bytes used to
    identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers.)"

    - The first 2 bytes of any BMP file must be the character "B" then the character "M" in ASCII.

10. What’s the difference between <bfSize> and <biSize>?

    - <bfSize> is the size, in bytes, of a bitmap file. <biSize> specifies the number of bytes required by the structure.

11. What does it mean if <biHeight> is negative?

    - <biHeight> specifies the height, in pixels, of a bitmap. If <biHeight> is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB, or device-independent bitmap,
    with its origin in the upper-left corner. NOTE: Top-down DIBs cannot be compressed.

12. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

    - The <biBitCount> specifies the number of bits per pixel. It defines the max number of colors in the bitmap.

13. Why might <fopen> return NULL in copy.c:37?

    - There may be a few reasons why <fopen> would return NULL in line 37 of copy.c. Since the program reaches line 37, there
    seems to be 2 command-line arguments, and since you are writing to a file in line 37, if the file doesn't already exist
    the program will create the file and store it in the current working directory. If the computer cannot
    allocate enough memory to create the desired file, NULL would be returned. Also, there may be a permissions error when
    trying to write to an open file, or you may not have access to that file.

14. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?

    - The third argument in fread is the count argument, which holds the maximum number of items to be read. In the comments above copy.c,
    it states that the program will read a BMP 'piece by piece', hence the 1.

15. What value does <copy.c:70> assign <padding> if <bi.biWidth> is 3?

    - <copy.c:70> would assign <padding> a value of 3 if <bi.biWidth> is 3.
    This is because the size of RGBTRIPLE = 3, and 3 * 3 = 9 --> 9 % 4 = 1 --> 4 - 1 = 3 --> 3 % 4 = 3.
    // int padding = (4 - (3 * 3 % 4) % 4;
    // int padding = 3;

16. What does <fseek> do?

    - <fseek> moves a file pointer to specified location. In copy.c's case, it skips over the padding int and
    looks for next RGBTRIPLE to read.

17. What is SEEK_CUR?

    - A constant that specifies the current position of the file pointer.

18. Whodunit?

    - Rob Bowden and his cat!
